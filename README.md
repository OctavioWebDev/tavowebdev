 React Portfolio of Octavio

**Description:**

The React Portfolio is a modern, web-based portfolio designed to showcase my professional and personal achievements, projects, and skills, as a Front End Developer and JavaScript Expert. This application is built using React, a popular JavaScript library, and leverages the Firebase platform for backend services and deployment. I want to give credit to https://www.youtube.com/@freecodecamp and https://www.youtube.com/@CodewithSloba, where I got the idea origanilly. I've made some minor omissions and changes.
